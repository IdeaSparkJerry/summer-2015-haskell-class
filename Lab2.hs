-- Lisp design goals
-- Implement the following:

-- S-expression parsing Data.Parsec
-- read, eval, print
-- car, cdr, cons, eq, atom, quote, if
-- +, -, *, /, <, >, >=, ==, /=, and, or as macros

-- lambda -- include recursion

-- Values include: Number, List, Symbol, Bool, String, Nil(?)

-- def, defun, defmacro
-- apply

-- load a file that defines factorial and map and range. use at repl.
-- none of this needs to be tail recursive or fast.
